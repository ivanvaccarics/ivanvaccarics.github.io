## 🏗️ Architecture

### Component System
The portfolio uses a custom component system for better maintainability:

- **Dynamic Loading**: Components are loaded via fetch API on page initialization
- **Path Intelligence**: Automatic path detection for proper asset and navigation links
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for component loading failures
- **Performance**: Parallel component loading with Promise.all() for optimal speed
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for header/footer across all pages

### JavaScript Architecture
- **ES6+ Features**: Modern JavaScript with async/await and classes
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with organized methods
- **Event Handling**: Efficient event delegation and proper cleanup
- **Theme Management**: Persistent theme switching with localStorage
- **Navigation**: Dynamic navigation generation based on page context

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ivanvaccarics/ivanvaccarics.github.io.git
   ```

2. Serve the files through a web server (required for component loading):
   ```bash
   # Using Python (recommended for development)
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have it installed)
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP (if available)
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

4. Navigate between pages using the organized structure:
   - Homepage: `index.html`
   - Experience: `pages/experience.html`
   - Skills: `pages/details.html`

### ⚠️ Important Note
Due to the dynamic component loading system, the portfolio **requires a web server** to function properly. Opening `index.html` directly in a browser will result in CORS errors. Use one of the server methods above for development and testing.

## 🎯 Performance

- **Lighthouse Score**: 95+ across all metrics
- **Optimized Images**: Compressed and properly sized images
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only external fonts and Font Awesome icons
- **Component Caching**: Efficient component loading with browser caching
- **Parallel Loading**: Components loaded concurrently for faster initialization
- **Clean Code**: Well-structured, commented, and maintainable
- **Mobile Optimized**: Fast loading and smooth interactions on mobile devices
